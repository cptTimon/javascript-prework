		<h2>We are honoured to welcome you to our little game. It's very old and known game, but we want to tell you about the rules anyway.</h2>
		<h4>You have to choose one of the buttons which will present your move: rock, paper os scissors. The oponent will choose one move as well.
			The rules are simple, rock beats the scissors and loses to paper, paper beats rocks and loses to scissors and so on scissors beats paper and loses to rock!
